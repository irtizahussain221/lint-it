Lintomatic is a configurable ESLint setup for JavaScript, React, and Vue projects. It provides a seamless way to choose and apply one of several ESLint configurations tailored to your coding style.

Lintomatic lets you easily set up ESLint with one of the following configurations:

ESLint + Prettier: Combines ESLint rules with Prettier formatting.
ESLint + Airbnb: Follows the popular Airbnb JavaScript style guide.
ESLint + Standard: Enforces JavaScript Standard Style.
ESLint with error prevention only: Focuses solely on preventing errors without enforcing stylistic rules.

Installation:

Install Lintomatic via npm or Yarn:

npm install lintomatic --save-dev

or


yarn add lintomatic --dev

npx lintomatic

Lintomatic will prompt you to choose your desired configuration for:

Once you've selected the options, Lintomatic will automatically generate and configure the necessary ESLint files for your project.
